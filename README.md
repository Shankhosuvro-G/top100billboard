This is a Python application that uses web scraping to create a Spotify playlist based on the Billboard Top 100 songs of any given year. The program will ask the user to enter a year, and then it will scrape the Billboard website to get the song titles and artists of that year. Next, it will use the Spotify API to search for the songs on Spotify and add them to a new playlist in the userâ€™s connected Spotify account. The playlist contain up to 100 songs, depending on their availability on Spotify. 

For the ease of user interface i have also incorporated gradio which will give it an app like interface to make it more user friendly
